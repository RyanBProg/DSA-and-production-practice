## Queue

### Problem Summary

Follow TTD principles and implement a custom queue data structure with built in methods for manipulating and storing data.

---

### Key Learning Takeaways

This project helped me better understand how queues works under the hood. It also gave me hands-on experience with TDD, testing best practices, and queue manipulation techniques in TypeScript.

---

### Design Decisions

The queue was implemented using a class-based approach. I chose to use an internal array to store the queueâ€™s items because it allows for simple and performant access to first-in-first-out operations. The class wraps this internal structure with a clear, queue-specific interface.

### âœ… Features Implemented

**Properties:**

- `.size`
- `.values`

**Methods:**

- `.clear()`
- `.peek()`
- `.isEmpty()`
- `.enqueue()`
- `.dequeue()`

---

### ðŸ§ª Edge Cases Considered

- operations performed on an empty stack returns undefined and does not throw an error.

---

### ðŸ“Š Time and Space Complexity

| Operation | Time Complexity |
| --------- | --------------- |
| Clear     | O(1)            |
| Peek      | O(1)            |
| isEmpty   | O(1)            |
| Enqueue   | O(1)            |
| Dequeue   | O(n)            |

The overall space complexity for the data structure is O(n), where n is the number of elements stored.

---

### ðŸ”— Testing

- **Unit tests** check initialsation, individual methods and properties are correct.
- **Integration tests** verify that a sequence of method calls works as expected and the data structure maintains integrity throughout.
