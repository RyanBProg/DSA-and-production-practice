# Welcome to my DSA Repo

## Motivation

This repo was created out of a need to develop the real-world, work-ready skills that most tutorials and bootcamps gloss over. Things like DSA, unit/integration testing, clean GitHub workflows, and professional collaboration practices. No sparkly new js frameworks will be practiced here, just the core, foundational skills needed to be effective in a professional enviroment.

In this project, I aim to play many roles in a typical development team, including:

- Issue raiser
- Feature builder
- Test author
- Code reviewer
- CI manager

This is both a technical sandbox and a living portfolio piece â€” a place to sharpen and showcase foundational developer practices.

## CI Features

- **Issue templates** are provided for bug reporting and feature requests to ensure consistency and clarity.
- **Custom pull request template** enforces a standard review procedure.
- **GitHub actions** for linting, type checking and test automation on push and pull request for smoother, less error prone project updates.
- **Repo guide** included to explain requirements and workflow for maintaining good repo hygiene.
